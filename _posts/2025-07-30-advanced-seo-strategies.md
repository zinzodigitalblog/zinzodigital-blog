## 🧐 1. Optimize for Search Intent

Ranking isn’t just about keywords — it’s about **satisfying what the user really wants**.

**Types of search intent:**

- **Informational:** Looking for an answer or tutorial  
- **Navigational:** Looking for a brand or website  
- **Transactional:** Ready to buy or take action  

**Tip:** Rework your content to directly address the *why* behind the search.

## 🔗 2. Build Strategic Backlinks

Backlinks from **relevant and trusted websites** are still one of Google’s top ranking factors.

**How to build backlinks:**

- Publish original research or statistics  
- Collaborate with other content creators  
- Submit guest posts on high-authority blogs  

✅ Avoid spammy backlinks — quality > quantity.

## ⚙️ 3. Improve Core Web Vitals

Google now considers **user experience metrics** in ranking.

Focus on:

- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)  
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)  
- First Input Delay (FID)  

Use [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to test your pages.

## 🛠️ 4. Add Schema Markup

Structured data helps Google show rich snippets.

Start with:

- Article schema  
- FAQ schema  
- Local business schema  

Test with [Google's Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results).

## 🔄 5. Refresh Old Content

Update older posts with:

- Better formatting  
- Current stats

Google rewards fresh, relevant content.
