## 1. Optimize for Search Intent

Ranking isn’t just about keywords — it’s about satisfying what the user really wants.

### Types of Search Intent:
- **Informational** – looking for knowledge (e.g., “how to start SEO”)
- **Transactional** – ready to buy (e.g., “hire SEO expert”)
- **Navigational** – looking for a specific brand/site

**Tip:** Rework your content to directly answer the *why* behind each search.

## 2. Build Strategic Backlinks

Backlinks from **trusted websites** are still one of Google’s top ranking factors.

### Ways to build them:
- Create original research
- Collaborate with content creators
- Submit guest posts on high-authority blogs

Avoid spammy links — focus on relevance and quality.

## 3. Improve Core Web Vitals

Google considers user experience in ranking.

Check and optimize:
- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint)
- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift)
- **FID** (First Input Delay)

Use [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to test your pages.

## 4. Add Schema Markup

Structured data helps Google understand your content and show rich snippets.

Start with:
- Article schema
- FAQ schema
- Local business schema

Test with [Google's Rich Results Tool](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)

## 5. Refresh Old Content

Update older blog posts with:
- Better formatting
- Current statistics
- New internal links

Google rewards fresh content that stays relevant.

---

## 6. Build Topical Authority

Group related articles into **content clusters**.

Example:
- Main page: “SEO”
  - Child posts: Keyword research, Link building, Technical SEO

Internally link all related content.
