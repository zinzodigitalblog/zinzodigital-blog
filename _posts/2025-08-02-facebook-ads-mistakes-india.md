Facebook is still one of India’s most powerful platforms for digital marketing. With over **400 million active users** across cities like Chennai, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Delhi — it remains a go-to for B2C and local service brands.

But many small to mid-sized businesses still treat Facebook Ads like a “boost button” — and as a result, they waste budget, get poor engagement, and assume the platform doesn't work.

If you're running Facebook Ads in India in 2025, here's what you should avoid — and what to do instead.

---

## ❌ Mistake #1: Using Boost Post Instead of Ads Manager

The infamous **Boost Post** button is quick and tempting — but it limits your targeting and optimization options.

Boosting simply promotes your post to a broad audience for engagement, not conversions.

✅ Instead:  
Use **Meta Ads Manager** to run structured campaigns with:
- Custom audiences
- Conversion tracking
- Placement control
- A/B testing

---

## ❌ Mistake #2: No Clear Campaign Objective

Many businesses don’t set a goal before running ads. Are you trying to:
- Get leads?
- Increase store visits?
- Drive ecommerce sales?
- Get video views?

Without a clear objective, your ad delivery will be unfocused.

✅ Instead:  
Pick from Facebook’s objective categories:
- Leads
- Messages
- Website traffic
- Conversions
- Catalog sales

And ensure your creative and landing page match the goal.

---

## ❌ Mistake #3: Targeting Everyone in India

We often see businesses targeting:

Location: India
Age: 28–65+

That’s the fastest way to burn money.

✅ Instead:
Use **layered targeting** like:
- City or region-specific (e.g., Chennai, Coimbatore)
- Language + interest combo
- Retargeting warm audiences via pixel or engagement

---

## ❌ Mistake #4: Poor Creatives with No Call-to-Action

An image with text and a logo isn’t enough.

In India’s scroll-heavy market, your ad needs to **stop thumbs**.

✅ Use:
- Video ads or motion graphics
- Reels format for mobile-first delivery
- Clear CTAs like “Book Now,” “Call Us,” or “WhatsApp Now”

---

## ❌ Mistake #5: Sending Traffic to Homepage or Irrelevant Pages

If your ad says “Get a free quote for AC repair in Chennai,” don’t send them to your generic homepage.

✅ Instead:
- Create a landing page that matches your ad’s offer
- Include your phone number and CTA above the fold
- Use lead forms for quicker conversion

---

## ❌ Mistake #6: No Retargeting Strategy

Most users won’t convert the first time they see your ad.

Yet many Indian businesses don’t:
- Set up pixel retargeting
- Follow up on ad viewers or video watchers
- Run multi-step campaigns

✅ Instead:
Use Facebook Pixel + Custom Audiences to retarget:
- Website visitors
- People who watched 50%+ of your video
- People who clicked on your last ad but didn’t convert

---

## ❌ Mistake #7: Ignoring WhatsApp Integration

In India, **WhatsApp is where deals happen**. Yet many ignore the power of Click-to-WhatsApp ads.

✅ Use message ads that:
- Go directly to WhatsApp
- Pre-fill messages like “Hi, I’m interested in your offer”
- Enable fast follow-up

---

## ✅ Bonus Tip: Use Regional Language + English

Targeting Tamil-speaking Chennai? Use bilingual ads.
Same for Hindi + English in North India.

It adds relatability and increases click-through rate.

---

## 🎯 Results Indian Businesses Have Achieved with the Right Strategy

- A real estate builder in Chennai reduced CPL by 40% using lead form ads and Tamil headlines
- A coaching center in Pune got 300+ inquiries in a month by retargeting video viewers with WhatsApp ads
- An ecommerce sari brand doubled their return on ad spend using dynamic creatives and catalog ads
