## 💡 How Instagram Ads Are Driving Fashion Sales in 2025

Let’s break down what’s actually working for fashion brands right now.

### 1. **Shoppable Posts & Reels**

Fashion brands are tagging their products directly in Reels and posts. Customers can tap → see product → and buy instantly.

✅ No need to leave Instagram.  
✅ Better for impulse buys.  
✅ Perfect for mobile-first shoppers.

### 2. **Carousel Ads for Lookbooks**

Instead of plain ads, brands are using carousel formats to:
- Show new collections
- Highlight seasonal colors
- Feature styling tips

It mimics the "swipe culture" users love, while showcasing multiple pieces in one ad.

### 3. **Video-first Campaigns**

Reels + Stories + Vertical videos = attention.

Many Singapore labels are:
- Filming behind-the-scenes content
- Featuring UGC (user-generated content) from real buyers
- Collaborating with micro-influencers to produce native-looking Reels

Video boosts engagement. On IG, **authenticity trumps polish**.
