## What Can You Learn From Rajesh's Journey?

If you're a business owner in Anna Nagar (or anywhere else) still depending only on traditional marketing like:

- Flyers
- Newspaper ads
- Auto rickshaw banners
- Word of mouth

Then you're **losing out** on 90% of your actual market â€” the online audience.

Hereâ€™s the truth:  
> **If your business is not online, it doesnâ€™t exist.**

People search for everything on Google now. Whether it's food, clothes, doctors, salons, or gifts â€” they look online first. If you're not showing up, you're invisible.
