# How to Do Keyword Research for Free (No Paid Tools Needed)

If you're a small business owner trying to rank higher on Google, **keyword research is the first step** — and the good news is, you don't need to spend money to get started.

Here’s how to do keyword research step-by-step using **only free tools**.

---

## 1. Start With Google Search Suggestions

Go to Google and start typing a phrase related to your service.

Example:  
Type “graphic design in” and Google will show suggestions like:  
- graphic design in Chennai  
- graphic design in Tamil Nadu  
- graphic design in Coimbatore  

These are **real searches by real people** — note them down!

## 2. Use “People Also Ask” & Related Searches

After searching your keyword, scroll down the results page.

- The **“People Also Ask”** box gives question-based keyword ideas  
- At the bottom, **“Related Searches”** shows more long-tail keywords  

These are great for blog post ideas or FAQ sections on your site.

## 3. Try Google Trends

Visit [trends.google.com](https://trends.google.com) and enter your topic.

- See how popular the keyword is over time  
- Compare different terms (e.g., “freelance designer” vs “creative agency”)  
- Choose keywords that are growing in interest in your area

## 4. Use AnswerThePublic (Free Version)

Go to [answerthepublic.com](https://answerthepublic.com) and enter your keyword.

- You’ll get a visual list of **question-based phrases**, like:  
  - What is graphic design used for?  
  - How to choose a graphic design agency?  
  - Is graphic design important for business?

These make great blog post or service page titles.

## 5. Use Google Search Console (If You Already Have Traffic)

If your site is connected to Google Search Console:

- Go to the **Performance** section  
- See which queries are already bringing you clicks and impressions  
- Use those keywords to improve existing pages or create new ones

This is one of the **best free keyword sources** because it's based on your real data.

## 6. Bonus: Try KeywordTool.io (Free Preview)

Visit [keywordtool.io](https://keywordtool.io) and enter a basic keyword.

- The free version gives a list of long-tail ideas  
- You can copy these to your research list  
- No login or credit card needed

## How to Choose the Right Keywords

Once you’ve collected ideas:

- Choose keywords that are **specific** (e.g., “logo design for clothing brand”)  
- Avoid very broad ones like “design” — they’re too competitive  
- Prioritize keywords with **clear intent** (informational or purchase)

## Final Thoughts

You don’t need expensive tools to find valuable keywords. All you need is time, strategy, and the right **free resources**.

Start small — pick a few relevant keywords and optimize your website pages or blog posts around them. That’s how real SEO growth begins.
