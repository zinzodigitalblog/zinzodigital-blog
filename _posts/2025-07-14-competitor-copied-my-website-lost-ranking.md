If you're here, this might sound familiar:

> "My website was ranking first on Google. Now a competitor copied my entire site — and *they* are ranking on top."

It’s frustrating. It feels unfair.  
And yes — **you can fix this**, but you need to act fast and smart.

## ❌ What Happens When Someone Copies Your Site?

A competitor may:
- Copy your entire HTML and design
- Modify colors or logo
- Keep the same headings, meta tags, and content
- Host it on another domain

If Google **detects duplicate content**, it may:
- Penalize both sites
- Confuse which is the original
- Accidentally favor the version with more backlinks or stronger signals

✅ **You need to prove you're the original.**

## 🧩 Step-by-Step: What You Should Do Now

---

### ✅ 1. Check If They Really Copied You

Use tools like:
- [Copyscape](https://www.copyscape.com)
- [Siteliner](https://www.siteliner.com)
- [Plagiarism Detector](https://www.plagiarismdetector.net)

Check how much they copied — exact paragraphs? meta tags? page layout?

Take screenshots as proof.

---

### ✅ 2. File a DMCA Complaint to Google

If you’re the original creator of the content, you can file a **DMCA takedown** request:

🔗 [Report content to Google – DMCA](https://support.google.com/legal/troubleshooter/1114905?hl=en)

You’ll need:
- Your original URLs
- Their copied URLs
- Explanation and your signature

Google may **remove their page from search results**.

---

### ✅ 3. Update Your Content – But Keep Authority

Don’t delete or rewrite everything out of fear.  
Instead:

- Add **fresh examples**, updated testimonials, or new visuals
- Rewrite 30–40% of each page to make it even better
- Add FAQs or video content to boost quality

🔁 Google likes **fresh + original + helpful** content.

---

### ✅ 4. Add Internal Linking and Schema

Reinforce your page’s authority with:
- Proper heading structure (`H1, H2, H3`)
- Clear internal links
- Location-based keywords
- Schema (JSON-LD)

Here’s a basic schema you can add:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Zinzo Digital",
  "url": "https://www.zinzodigital.com",
  "logo": "https://www.zinzodigital.com/assets/images/logo.png",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "78, Sri Mahaganapathy Nagar",
    "addressLocality": "Ayyampettai",
    "addressRegion": "Tamil Nadu",
    "postalCode": "631501",
    "addressCountry": "IN"
  },
  "telephone": "+91 8148038211",
  "sameAs": [
