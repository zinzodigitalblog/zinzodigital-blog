# Why Did My Flower Boutique in Koyambedu Stop Getting Calls from Google?

Your flower boutique in **Koyambedu, Chennai** was receiving steady calls and orders from **Google Search and Maps** until June 2025. Suddenly:

- 🔇 No more calls  
- 📉 Low or no enquiries  
- 🧭 You changed SEO providers and updated the site — but still no improvement

If this sounds like your story, you're not alone.  
At **Zinzo Digital**, we've helped several local businesses regain lost visibility after major Google changes.

## ❓ Why Did My Calls Suddenly Drop?

Several things can cause a **local ranking drop**, especially after:

- Google algorithm updates
- SEO agency switch
- Website design or structure changes

---

## 🔍 Let’s Fix It – Step by Step

### ✅ 1. Check If Your Google Business Profile Was Changed or Suspended

- Are you still **verified** on Google Business?
- Was your **business category** changed?
- Did someone remove or update your **address**, **contact number**, or **service area**?

📌 Even minor edits can **drop you off the map.**

---

### ✅ 2. Check If Website URLs or Structure Changed

If your florist website changed from:

`/flower-delivery-koyambedu.html`  
➡️ to  
`/bouquets.html`

… and the old page was ranking, you just lost traffic.  
**Always use proper 301 redirects** if URLs change.

✅ Make sure your new pages:
- Have similar content
- Target the same local keywords
- Are indexed by Google

---

### ✅ 3. Audit Your Local SEO Signals

Google uses multiple factors for local rankings:

| Signal                | What to check                                  |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| NAP Consistency       | Is your Name, Address, Phone same everywhere?  |
| Google Reviews        | Did your rating drop? Fewer new reviews?       |
| Local Keywords        | Are you still using “Koyambedu florist”?       |
| Page Titles & H1 Tags | Do they still have “Chennai” or “Koyambedu”?   |
| Business Category     | Is it still set as “Florist” or “Flower Shop”? |

✅ Run an audit using [BrightLocal](https://www.brightlocal.com) or [GMB Everywhere](https://gmbeverywhere.com)

### ✅ 4. Fix Content That Was Changed by New SEO Agency

Ask yourself:

- Did they remove local area names?
- Did they use AI-generated content with no personalization?
- Did they add too many keywords and make it spammy?

Your content must be:
- Natural
- Location-rich
- Aligned with user intent like “same-day flower delivery Koyambedu”

---

### ✅ 5. Rebuild Local Trust with Reviews

If reviews slowed down, **Google will reduce your exposure.**

📌 Ask past customers for:
- A fresh review
- Specific mention of “Koyambedu flower delivery” in text
- Upload a photo with flowers

✅ Aim for 1–2 new reviews per week consistently.

---

### ✅ 6. Run a Local Ranking Tracker

Use tools like:
- Google Search Console → check impressions/clicks drop
- Ubersuggest or Ahrefs → check if keywords disappeared
- Grid My Business → map ranking tracker

This tells you **where the issue started** — Maps? Organic? Mobile? Desktop?

---

### ✅ 7. Add Fresh Location Content

Post blogs like:
- “5 Best Flower Gifting Ideas in Koyambedu”
- “How to Order a Birthday Bouquet in Chennai Within 2 Hours”
- “Why Zinzo Flowers is Trusted by Koyambedu Locals”

Google loves **fresh content + local intent.**
