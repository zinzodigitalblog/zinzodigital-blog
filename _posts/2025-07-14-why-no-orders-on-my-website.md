# Why Am I Not Getting Orders Through My Website?

You’ve launched a website, added your products or services… but orders just aren’t coming in.

This is one of the **most common frustrations** for small business owners — and it’s fixable.

At **Zinzo Digital**, we’ve helped dozens of websites go from **0 orders to 100+ per month** by auditing and optimizing the real reasons behind the silence.

## 🧠 1. You Have No Traffic (or the Wrong Kind)

If people aren’t visiting your site, they can’t buy from you.

Check your traffic using tools like:

- [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com)
- [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/)
- [Ahrefs Webmaster Tools](https://ahrefs.com/webmaster-tools)

If your traffic is below 100–200 visits per month, you need:

- **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**
- **Social media strategy**
- **Content marketing**
- **Google Ads or Facebook Ads**

---

## 🔍 2. You're Not Visible on Google

Try searching for your services on Google:

- “T-shirt printing in Chennai”
- “Best home cleaning service Coimbatore”

Does your site appear on page 1? If not, you're invisible.

✅ You need **local SEO** + keyword optimization  
✅ Add schema + location pages  
✅ Get listed in Google Business

## 🧭 3. Visitors Don’t Know What to Do

If your homepage doesn’t tell people exactly:

- What you offer
- Why they should trust you
- What to do next (CTA)

Then people leave.

**Fix it:**
- Add a “Buy Now” or “Get Quote” button above the fold
- Use simple headlines
- Show photos or testimonials

---

## ⚙️ 4. Slow Website Speed

Slow sites = lost orders.

Use [Google PageSpeed](https://pagespeed.web.dev) or [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com) to test.

**Ideal speed:**  
- Mobile load: under 3 seconds  
- Desktop load: under 2 seconds

Compress images, use fast hosting, and avoid bloated plugins.

---

## 📱 5. Your Site Isn’t Mobile Friendly

Over **85% of users** visit from smartphones.

If your website is hard to tap, pinch, scroll, or read — they’ll quit.

✅ Use responsive design  
✅ Test on different phones  
✅ Make forms and buttons mobile-first

---

## 🔐 6. No Trust Factors

Would you buy from a site with:

- No reviews?
- No company info?
- No SSL (padlock)?

You must **build trust** by adding:

- Testimonials
- Google reviews
- Phone number + address
- Secure HTTPS (SSL)
- WhatsApp/chat buttons

---

## 📉 7. Your Pricing Is Unclear or Hidden

People don’t want to call just to ask for a price.

Even if you can’t list exact rates, provide:

- “Starting from ₹___”
- Transparent packages
- Offers like “Free demo” or “First 20% off”

---

## 📥 8. You Don't Have Conversion Triggers

Use conversion boosters:

- Popups with offers  
- Limited-time deals  
- Scarcity (“Only 3 slots left”)  
- Exit-intent banners

These increase urgency and drive action.

---

## 🧪 9. No Tracking = No Improvement

If you don’t track:

- Clicks
- Scrolls
- Abandoned carts
- Contact form fills

Then you're **guessing** what’s working.

✅ Use tools like:
- Google Analytics (GA4)
- Facebook Pixel
- Hotjar or Microsoft Clarity (for heatmaps)

---

## 💡 10. You Launched and Forgot to Market

Just publishing a website is not enough.

You need to actively market it:

- SEO
- Instagram reels
- Google Ads
- Email follow-ups
- WhatsApp broadcasts

Marketing = traffic  
Traffic + conversion = orders

---

## 👣 What You Need to Do Now

1. **Audit your traffic and page speed**
2. **Improve your homepage layout and call-to-action**
3. **Start basic SEO (on-page, schema, Google Business)**
4. **Make it mobile-friendly**
5. **Track everything using Google tools**
