You’re in the **used car business**.  
You **don’t have a website**, and you **don’t want to spend money on ads**.  
But you still want people to:

- Contact you to buy cars  
- Call you to sell their cars  
- Trust your business online

**Yes, it’s possible.**  
Here’s how to use **free online methods** to promote your car buying/selling business in 2025.

## ✅ 1. Instagram + Facebook = Your Free Showroom

You don’t need a website if you treat your **social media pages** like your digital showroom.

### Create:
- A **Facebook Page** (not just personal profile)
- A **dedicated Instagram Business Account**

Use a name like:  
**@CityUsedCars**  
**@FastDealsAuto**

## 📸 2. What to Post Daily (Free but Powerful)

To grow organically, **consistency wins**.

Here’s what you should post every day:

| Post Type               | Example                               |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ✅ Car Photos          | Front, side, dashboard, odometer       |
| 📋 Car Info Text       | Model, year, km run, price, contact    |

```

Add this to:
