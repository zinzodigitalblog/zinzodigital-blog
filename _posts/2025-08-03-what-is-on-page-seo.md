# What Is On-Page SEO? A Beginner’s Guide for Small Businesses

If you’re wondering why your website isn’t ranking higher on Google, the answer might be right in front of you — on the page itself.

**On-page SEO** is the process of optimizing the content and structure of individual pages on your website so they rank better in search engines and provide a better experience to visitors.

Let’s break it down into simple steps.

---

## 1. Start with the Right Title Tag

The title tag is what appears as the clickable headline in Google search.

- Keep it under 60 characters  
- Include your main keyword near the beginning  
- Make it attractive to click  

Example: `T-shirt Printing in Chennai | Free Design Support`

---

## 2. Write a Compelling Meta Description

This is the short summary below your title in search results.

- Keep it under 160 characters  
- Mention your service and unique benefit  
- Encourage clicks with action words like “Call now” or “Get free quote”  

---

## 3. Use Proper Heading Tags (H1, H2, H3)

Search engines use headings to understand your content.

- Each page should have **one H1 tag** — usually the main title  
- Use H2 for main sections and H3 for sub-points  
- Don’t skip levels (no jumping from H1 to H4)

---

## 4. Optimize Your Content for Keywords

Your page content should answer what people are searching for.

- Use your main keyword naturally in the first 100 words  
- Add secondary or related keywords throughout  
- Don’t overstuff — write for humans first, Google second

---

## 5. Add Internal Links

Link to other helpful pages on your own website.

Example: If you’re writing about “Web Design,” you can link to your “Portfolio” or “Pricing” page.

Internal links help Google crawl your site and keep users engaged longer.

---

## 6. Use Optimized Images

Images can boost SEO if used right.

- Name your files clearly (e.g., `custom-tshirt-chennai.jpg`)  
- Add descriptive **alt text**  
- Compress images so your site loads faster  

---

## 7. Make the Page Mobile Friendly

Most users are on mobile. Your content should:

- Be easy to scroll and tap  
- Use large fonts and buttons  
- Avoid pop-ups or slow-loading elements  

Google gives mobile-friendly sites better ranking priority.

---

## 8. Improve Page Speed

Slow pages hurt SEO and user experience.

- Compress images  
- Use lightweight themes  
- Minimize plugins and unnecessary scripts  

Fast-loading sites rank better and convert more.

---

## Final Thoughts

On-page SEO isn’t about tricking Google — it’s about making your pages clearer, faster, and more helpful to real people.

By applying these simple steps on every important page of your website, you’ll improve your chances of ranking higher, getting more traffic, and turning visitors into customers.
