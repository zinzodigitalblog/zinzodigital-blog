## The Problem: Website with No Visibility

Meet Rakesh, owner of a local interior design firm in Kanchipuram. Despite launching a beautiful website in early 2024, traffic was nearly **non-existent**.

- ❌ No organic search clicks  
- ❌ No inquiries or bookings  
- ❌ Ad budget wasted with zero return  

> “I thought having a website meant people would find me. But no one even knew I existed.”  
> — *Rakesh, Small Business Owner*

## The Symptoms

Rakesh’s Google Analytics showed:

- <span style="color:red;">Bounce rate over 85%</span>  
- Average session time: 12 seconds  
- Ad clicks not converting  
- Keyword rankings: not even in top 50

He was **spending without strategy**, and it hurt.
