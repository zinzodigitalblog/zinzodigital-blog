## 🛠️ 1. Set Up and Verify Your Website

## 📊 2. Check Performance Report

Under **Performance**, you can see:

- Total clicks and impressions  
- Average click-through rate (CTR)  
- Average position in Google search results

Use filters to find:

## 🚧 3. Fix Indexing Issues

Go to the **Coverage** report to see:

- Pages Google has indexed  
- Pages with errors or warnings  
- Reasons why some pages aren’t indexed

Fix errors like 404s, server issues, or blocked resources and submit fixed pages for re-indexing.

## 🕷️ 4. Submit a Sitemap

A sitemap helps Google crawl your site efficiently.

- Create a sitemap (usually `sitemap.xml`)  
- Submit it under **Sitemaps** in GSC

This ensures new and updated pages get indexed faster.

## 🔗 5. Check Mobile Usability

Google prioritizes mobile-friendly sites.

- Go to **Mobile Usability** report  
- Fix errors like clickable elements too close or content wider than screen

## 🔄 6. Monitor Security Issues and Manual Actions

Under **Security & Manual Actions**, check if Google flags any penalties or hacking attempts.

Fix issues quickly to avoid ranking drops.

## 📈 7. Use URL Inspection Tool

Inspect individual URLs for:

- Index status  
- Last crawl date  
- Mobile usability  
- Structured data errors

You can also request indexing of new or updated pages here.
