India’s handmade craft industry is rich with tradition, color, and creativity. But in 2025, even the most beautiful products can go unseen without a proper digital marketing strategy.

## 🇮🇳 Why Handmade Craft Sellers Need Digital Marketing

Traditional marketing methods (exhibitions, foot traffic, word-of-mouth) are limited by geography.

Digital platforms allow:
- National & international reach
- Direct customer relationships
- Low-cost product showcasing
- Brand storytelling
- 24/7 shop access via ecommerce or DMs

The best part? You don’t need a huge budget — just **consistency, creativity, and cultural pride**.

## 💡 Marketing Strategies to Try in 2025

### ✅ 1. Geo Targeting on Instagram/Facebook

Use paid ads starting at ₹200/day with:

### ✅ 2. Offer “Made to Order” and “Custom” Options
Handmade buyers often love personalization.

Use forms or simple Google Sheets to collect:

It builds emotional connection and reduces returns.

Use tools like:
- **Canva** for posters, stories, price lists

## 💸 Managing Payments & Logistics

Use:
- **Paytm / Razorpay / UPI links**
